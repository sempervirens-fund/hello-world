Following Github guide instructions :)
We are Californiaâ€™s first land trust, and since 1900 Sempervirens Fund has protected more than 54 square miles of redwood-forested land in the Santa Cruz Mountains and helped establish three state and two regional parks. We often own and restore land until it can be managed by public agencies. Thanks to our supporters, we have helped establish and expand public parks you can explore today, and we currently own and care for 11,000 more acres of properties.
